<h1>Owen's Past, Present, and Future</h1>

<h2>Past Life</h2>

<section>

<p> I was born in Glendale Hospital in Glendale, Arizona. I was raised in Phoenix and lived there until we moved to South Carolina on December 12, 2015. My family has lived in several homes over the years, however most of my life was spent in a brick house on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/3513+W.+Lawrence+Rd.+Phoenix+AZ+85019/@33.5355477,-112.1350994,3a,75y,182.96h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m4!1s-8vDW7dlHUsWUaCSBidqpw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x631e412952e65a7c!6m1!1e1">3513 W.

<h2>Present Day</h2>

<p> After driving 1,991 miles from Arizona, I now live here in Greenville, South Carolina. I live with my mom, dad, and little sister in a dope apartment complex. Armed with nothing but my headphones and my ring, I attempt to excel here at Mann. I enjoy listening to dubstep, making dubstep, drawing, and playing videogames.</p>

<p>No, I'm not high in these pictures. This was from my 16th birthday, which is marked as the first birthday I've had here. I was saying "Suh dude" and my friend Vinny took a picture of me. Go figure. By the way, the word on my shirt reads 'Getter'. You can check him out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getter_(musician)">wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p>What do I plan to do after I finish high school? Well, luckily I'm only two years in, so I've got time to think. For college, I'd like to find a prestigious digital art academy so I can pursue my dream of being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design">graphic designer</a>. After college I figure I'll marry the girl of my dreams and start a family. I'd also like to see about becoming a professional DJ and headline festivals around the globe. Nothing's set in stone yet, but I've got a pretty good idea.</p>
